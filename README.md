Warming up to start coding

Functions to be used:
1. document.getElementById(“id given”): document.getElementById() is used to fetch an element from the HTML page having the id as provided (specified) by the user.
“.value” is used to access the value of the HTML element accessed.

2. Math.random() : The random() function is used to generate a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). This generated number is then multiplied with 10 and added 1 to generate numbers from 1 – 10. (if you only want to play in the range of 1-10. Later, game range can be decided object guessRange.min and guessRange.max)
